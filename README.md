### **How the game works**

1. User is presented with a screen to guess the Super Hero character.
2. User has 12 tries to find the correct Super Heo name.
3. Once user presses the first letter, the number of tries aka guesses decrements by 1.
4. If a user guesses the word, he is presented witha Text saying "You Won" and the number of wins increments by 1.
5. If a user is unable to guess the word in 12 tries, then the Wins counter does not increment and the user is presented with the text "You Lost".
